This is all the code for the website fuzzyrainbow.com.

The main content is currently just static html/css. 

The flower garden at the bottom is dynamically drawn client-side with 
processing.js onto an HTML5 canvas.

Images and stylesheets are stored in Amazon S3.  To set this up, I 
configured GoDaddy's Total Domain Control to point 
http://cdn.fuzzyrainbow.com to an Amazon S3/CloudFront bucket that 
acts as a static file server.  (Any S3 uploader, e.g. S3Fox or S3 
Organizer works well for uploading static files.)

The index page is served from Nginx, running on a Linode VPS (Ubuntu 
9.10).  It was the easiest way to work around Amazon S3/CloudFront's 
limitation of not being able to serve default root pages/index files.

The .js files are served from Nginx as well, to avoid cross-site js 
browser warnings.
